  abstract = {Ground vibrations induced by human activities that can be considered a statistically stationary process can be represented by analytical solutions to Lamb's problem. For a viscously damped half-space modeled as a Kelvin-Voigt solid, the attenuation is governed by radiation and an exponential law with an argument dependent on the soil's damping ratio and Rayleigh wavelength. An estimator of the damping ratio is presented based on an energy analysis, and a field scale is introduced to filter near-field components from measurements. A spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW)\textendash type test is used to determine the Rayleigh wave velocity through a frequency wavenumber transformation of the wave field, and the vibrations caused by a periodic excitation are used to determine the damping ratio. A comparison against a pseudo-attenuation power law is presented in terms of ground vibration prediction.}

  abstract = {In 1954, four earthquakes of M {$>$} 6.0 occurred within a 30 km radius in a period of six months. The Rainbow Mountain-Fairview Peak-Dixie Valley earthquakes are among the largest to have been recorded geodetically in the Basin and Range province. The Fairview Peak earthquake (M=7.2, December 12, 1954) followed two events in the Rainbow Mountains (M=6.2, July 6, and M=6.5, August 24, 1954) by 6 months. Four minutes later the Dixie Valley fault ruptured (M=6.7, December 12, 1954). The changes in static stresses caused by the events are calculated using the Coulomb-Navier failure criterion and assuming uniform slip on rectangular dislocations embedded in an elastic half-space. Coulomb stress changes are resolved on optimally oriented faults and on each of the faults that ruptured in the chain of events. These calculations show that each earthquake in the Rainbow Mountain-Fairview Peak-Dixie Valley sequence was preceded by a static stress change that encouraged failure. The magnitude of the stress increases transferred from one earthquake to another ranged from 0.01 MPa (0.1 bar) to over 0.1 MPa (1 bar). Stresses were reduced by up to 0.1 MPa over most of the Rainbow Mountain-Fairview Peak area as a result of the earthquake sequence. Copyright 1996 by the American Geophysical Union.}

  abstract = {Demand and capacity factor design (DCFD) is a probability-based load and resistance factor (LRFD)-like format used for performance-based seismic design and assessment of structures. The DCFD format is based on a technical framework that provides a closed-form analytical expression for the mean annual frequency of exceeding (or not exceeding) a structural performance level, which is usually defined as specified structural parameters (e.g., ductility, strength, maximum drift ratio) reaching a structural limit state (e.g., onset of yield, collapse). This report, which is presented in two parts, provides a step-by-step and detailed description of the development of the technical framework underlying the DCFD format, accompanied by helpful illustrations and numerical examples. In the first part, a closed-form analytic expression for the mean annual frequency of exceeding a structural limit state is derived based on certain simplifying assumptions. The expression for mean annual frequency of exceedance is derived by taking into account the aleatory uncertainty (due to inherent randomness) and the epistemic uncertainty (due to limited knowledge) in three main elements},

The overall trend of the Central Kaibab fault system is north, but individual faults trend north, northwest, northeast, and approximately east-west. Along the southern half of the fault system, faulting is expressed as fairly high, gentle, west-facing scarps formed on Paleozoic bedrock, with Quaternary deposits in linear valleys along their bases. Quaternary activity is possible on at least some of these faults based on their geomorphic expression, but it has not been conclusively demonstrated.}

While the results can only be considered to be strictly applicable to these conditions, it is hoped that they can also serve as a guide to possible relationships between peak accelerations and peak velocities which may be expected for earthquakes of higher magnitudes occurring in different locations and thereby serve a useful purpose in the difficult task of predicting the likely characteristics of earthquake ground motions in different geological settings.},

  abstract = {La falla de instalaciones mineras cr\'iticas sometidas a movimientos s\'ismicos fuertes, puede tener consecuencias muy graves para la vida y el medio ambiente y el dise\~no s\'ismico de estas instalaciones debe asegurar en general una muy baja probabilidad de falla en todas las etapas de vida \'util de la mina, desde la construcci\'on, la operaci\'on y el cierre definitivo de la instalaci\'on. El estado actual de la pr\'actica define los sismos de dise\~no a partir de una probabilidad anual de excedencia en t\'erminos de aceleraciones   y pseudo-aceleraciones   m\'aximas de suelo duro, que se basan en las consecuencias de la falla de la instalaci\'on. Las aceleraciones y pseudo-aceleraciones horizontales son medidas de intensidadadecuadas para estimar la respuesta din\'amica de sistemas din\'amicos que responden como un oscilador de un grado de libertad (SDOF) amortiguado, y por otra parte, permiten estimar directamente la capacidad \'ultima de servicio en estructuras cuya falla est\'a controlada por fuerzas de inercia. La estabilidad s\'ismica de los taludes de dep\'ositos de desechos y pilas de lixiviaci\'on, las presiones hidrodin\'amicas en tapones y barricadas hidr\'aulicas en t\'uneles mineros, las deformaciones m\'aximas en tuber\'ias de gran di\'ametro enterradas, o la licuaci\'on din\'amica de un estrato de arenas saturadas, son algunos ejemplos de sistemas cuya respuesta din\'amica est\'a pobremente correlacionada con las aceleraciones m\'aximas del evento s\'ismico. Los terremotos de dise\~no de sistemas din\'amicos de este tipo, requieren la estimaci\'on de una probabilidad anual de excedencia basadas en otras medidas de intensidad, tales como la velocidad m\'axima del terreno  , las intensidades de Arias  , las velocidades acumuladas  . Estas medidas de intensidad est\'an correlacionadas con las aceleraciones horizontales y pueden explicarse mediante modelos de regresi\'on probabil\'isticos sencillos, que incorporen adem\'as la probabilidad anual de excedencia de las aceleraciones m\'aximas. En este trabajo, se proponen modelos de aprendizaje supervisado para estimar la probabilidad anual de excedencia de medidas de intensidad correlacionadas con aceleraciones. Los modelos se entrenaron a partir de una base de registros s\'ismicos y curvas de peligrosidad s\'ismica de todo el mundo, que forman parte del trabajo de investigaci\'on de Doctorado.}
